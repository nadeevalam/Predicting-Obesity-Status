# Predicting-Obesity-Status

The notebook, datasets, and accompanying predictions in this repository were a part of my final project for STATS 101C (Statistical Models and Data Mining) at UCLA with Professor Almohalwas. The project was a Kaggle competition to predict obesity status. You can view the specifications of the competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predicting-obesity-status/overview).
