# Predicting Obesity Status

This repository contains the notebook, datasets, and predictions developed as part of my final project for **STATS 101C: Statistical Models and Data Mining** at UCLA, taught by Professor Almohalwas. The goal of this project was to predict obesity status as part of a Kaggle competition.

## Project Overview

In this competition, the challenge was to build a predictive model to classify individuals as "Obese" or "Not Obese" based on various demographic, behavioral, and health-related features. This project required applying advanced machine learning techniques, exploring feature engineering, and optimizing model performance.

## Contents

The repository includes the following:

- **Notebook**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanation of the steps followed for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.
- **Datasets**: The training and test datasets used in the project.
- **Predictions**: The final predictions submitted to the Kaggle competition.
